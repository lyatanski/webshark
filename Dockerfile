# webshark - Wireshark in the browser: a static page and a Go server over
# sharkd, built here from Wireshark master with Lua enabled.
#
# plugins/ims.lua relates SIP to Diameter by the subscriber identity
# WIRESHARK_PLUGIN_DIR is what makes that directory the plugin directory: it
# takes precedence over the compiled-in path, and Lua plugin loading walks
# subdirectories, so a mounted tree works too.
#
# Wireshark tracks master, rebuilt on a schedule by CI to pick up upstream
# changes. To pin it instead:
#
#     docker build --build-arg WIRESHARK=v4.6.7 .
